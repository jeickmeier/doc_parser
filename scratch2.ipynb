       "\n",
       "As credit markets have matured and become electronic, macro credit products - instruments that give broad exposure to the market - have become an increasingly used and liquid part of the investor toolbox. One of the more recent additions to the suite of available products are credit futures offered by Eurex, CBOE and CME. These products allow investors to gain broad access to investment grade and high yield USD, EUR or GBP corporate credit bond markets.\n",
       "\n",
       "As futures, the instruments are exchange traded and allow unfunded exposure to the underlying market. The underlying instrument in the futures are bond indices offered by either S&P or Bloomberg. These indices are total return indices, which means that investors have exposure to the yield return of the bonds in the indices.\n",
       "\n",
       "Credit index futures volumes have grown rapidly over the past few years, with outstanding Open Interest now at 4.5bn and average daily volumes of close to $1bn in 2025. While these volumes are small in comparison to some of the other macro credit products (CDS indices traded $150bn/day in 2025, see **CD Player**, 18 June), they have now overtaken Total Return Swap volumes, increasing three times vs 2024.\n",

       "**Uses**  \n",
       "The case for credit futures is that they provide flexible and scalable instruments for managing corporate bond exposures. The standardised nature of the instrument, along with it being exchange traded and centrally cleared, means that it has appeal to a broad array of market participants and can provide cost-effective access to corporate bond benchmarks. Typical use cases are:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Liquidity and cash management.** When large fund inflows occur, it can be efficient to take exposure to the benchmark index returns via futures which are unfunded while maintaining cash and searching for the right bonds to buy.\n",
       "- **Hedging purposes.** For a fund pursuing an active bond selection aimed at outperforming the market, futures can be used to temporarily reduce portfolio market exposure.\n",
       "- **Portfolio overlay and beta adjustment.** Futures can be used to increase or reduce market exposure in a portfolio.\n",
       "- **Tactical and relative value trades.** Credit Index Futures typically reference the same or similar markets to ETFs, TRS and CDS indices. As such, investors can trade relative value between these instruments to take advantage of pricing discrepancies. The underlying benchmark indices for different products can be found in the appendix.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Exchange Offerings\n",
       "Credit Index futures are currently offered by three exchanges - Eurex, Cboe and CME. All three have futures referencing USD Investment Grade and High Yield indices. In addition, Eurex offers futures on Euro and Sterling Investment Grade and Euro High Yield indices. CME has also launched a duration-hedged USD Investment Grade and High Yield products, which give investors exposure to the credit spread component of the total return while hedging the rates component.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Volumes and Open Interest\n",
       "Volumes and open interest in credit futures have continued to grow in 2025 with open interest recently passing $4.5bn and average daily volumes of close to $1bn over the past few months (Figure 1 and Figure 2). While this is somewhat skewed by the roll periods, June 2025 saw $1bn of average daily activity compared to $600m of daily activity in June 2024.\n",

       "- Credit futures are cash-settled products traded on an underlying total return corporate bond index.\n",
       "- The cash-settled nature means that at expiry, the investor will pay (or receive) the difference between the initial entry price and the final price on settlement, determined by the exchange.\n",
       "- Typically, market participants will either roll or unwind their position prior to the futures expiry so that few futures are likely to settle at the final price.\n",
       "- Daily margining of the product means that there is unlikely to be a large payment on exit as the total return over the period includes the daily mark-to-market valuation.\n",

       "Unlike bond futures, which settle on a cash price of the bond (with a factor adjustment), credit index futures settle on a total return index. The daily return of the underlying index is the aggregate price return of all the underlying bonds in the index, plus the daily accrued from each bond. It is, in essence, a dirty price index that includes any coupons paid by the underlying bonds. Over time, the index accrues positively, reflecting the total return of the bonds in the index.\n",
       "\n",
       "For example, the Euro Investment Grade future offered by Eurex, FECX (Bloomberg Ticker: LXY), references the Bloomberg MSCI Euro Corporate Bond Socially Responsible Index (RECMTREU). This underlying index includes all euro-denominated corporate bonds that meet the inclusion criteria set by Bloomberg and MSCI. The future price reflects the level of the index plus funding to the term of the future, as we discuss later. The upward trend in the index differs from the price of a comparable ETF as coupons/dividends are not paid out of the index but rather accumulated (Figure 3).\n",

For example, the USD IG future traded on Cboe (IBIG) has a contract multiplier of 1,000.

       "### Sizing and PnL Example\n",
       "A credit PM gets an inflow of $50mm in early January and is looking for a quick and efficient way to gain all-in yield (spread and interest rate) exposure to the broad USD IG market. The PM can do so by purchasing CME QIB futures while awaiting new issuance / supporting secondary conditions to invest cash. The PnL of the trade will track the total return performance of the USD IG benchmark (in this case as represented by the LUACTRUU Index) less financing costs, which could be offset by putting the cash into a money market account.\n",
       "\n",
       "Let’s assume the inflow arrives on 8 January 2025; the liquid / nearest future contract is the March Expiry (QIBH25). Assume Bid/Offer is 3290.00 / 3293.00. For reference, the previous EOD close of the NAV for LUACTRUU index was 3269.31.\n",
       "\n",
       "The contract multiplier is 30 so a single contract exposure / value is $98,790 (=3293 x 30). To get $50mm exposure (off the offer side, but can also use mid or bid), the PM would look to purchase 506 contacts (= $50mm / $98,790). The trade exposure is $49,987,740, but only Initial Margin changes hands initially. Given the initial margin is 1.3%, the PM posts $649,841 at trade initiation. Margins will often be lower than this as exchanges will often give offsets for offsetting trades, e.g. on a rates CME-cleared product, the PM could get up to 75% offset. There are additional fees paid to the exchange, but these are typically small.\n",
       "\n",
       "As the market moves, the Variation Margin will be paid/received and calculated as (Daily Settlement Price – Entry Price) x # of contracts. As the contract approaches expiry, the futures price will converge to the underlying index level (aka spot). If the PM holds the futures to the settlement on Wednesday, 19 March (last trading date would be Tuesday 18 March), the cash settlement will be based on the NAV index fixing, for that day at 4pm ET. For example, LUACTRUU Index NAV on 19 March was 3355.86, so the total P&L would be $954,215 (=3355.86 - 3293) x 506 x 30) or 1.91% appreciation from Trade Date on the exposure of $50mm.\n",
       "\n",
       "Note that the benchmark return for LUACTRUU over this period was 2.65%, with the difference due to the transaction cost and financing cost component (which is embedded in the futures price – see more discussion later), which deducts from the PnL long in case of long risk / buy futures position. The difference of 0.74% is roughly equal to financing the trade at SOFR (4.25%) for 70 days.\n",
       "\n",
       "If the PM were to unwind the position prior to expiry, the PnL will be calculated in a similar fashion, but using exit price / bid quote of the contract. Alternatively, the PM may choose to keep the exposure and roll the position (by selling the “expiring” near-month futures and purchase far-month futures), typically several days prior to the contract’s last trading day to avoid PIN risk of the underlying index and ensure certainty of the trading levels, roll and financing costs.\n",

The fair value for the future is shown in Figure 5. The pricing dynamic of the future and index can be seen in Figure 6, where we plot the next future contract relative to the underlying index spot level. The two time-series are correlated, but the future pulls to spot as time passes such that on an expiry day, the future and spot are the same level. In Figure 7 we plot the 1st and 2nd Future contract relative to the spot. The 2nd contract starts with a greater premium to the spot due to the longer time to expiry. This pulls lower until the 2nd contract becomes the 1st contract and eventually expires at the spot.\n",

       "This Premium/Basis is the cost of being long or short the future in excess of the funding cost - on an annualised basis, it can be thought of as the implied funding spread. For a cash asset, this is the financing or borrow cost of the asset. If the Premium is positive, it means that there is demand to be long the asset and a positive associated financing cost. Similarly, if the Premium is negative, there is demand to be short the asset and therefore a financing or borrow cost embedded in the future’s price.\n",

       "### Adjusted Future Basis\n",
       "The nature of credit index futures, specifically the fact that it is a theoretical portfolio of bonds meeting the inclusion criteria, means that there is some latency in updating the level of the bonds in the underlying index. The premium also captures this latency as a premium or discount reflecting the true price of the bond portfolio. An analogy is the premium-to-NAV on an ETF where the ETF updates more frequently than the underlying bonds and therefore trades at a premium or discount to reflect this. The ETF additionally captures a bid/ask spread since the ETF NAV is marked at the bid, while transactions tend to happen at the offer.\n",
       "\n",
       "It is not clear to us whether this second market quantity should be captured by the future’s premium since the future does expire at NAV — in theory, an investor could buy or sell the future and capture this premium on a quarterly basis as the future expires and rolls to NAV. However, since most transactions are rolled, or closed prior to expiry, the premium is not available in practice. In practice, one would typically hedge with the ETF rather than a portfolio of bonds and as such the index latency would typically disappear from the trade.\n",
       "\n",
       "Adjusting the spot index by the ETF Premium-to-NAV (in excess of typical B/O) therefore allows us to back out the clean funding spread of the future. In Figure 11 we show the funding spread implied by the future compared to the funding spread implied from the TRS market over the last three years (CD Player, 2 Sep 2016, for more on TRS and ETFs). The two are correlated, but opportunities often exist where one may offer a better trade in one direction or the other. Figure 12 shows some recent history, where we can see that while the funding spread in EUR IG TRS is very negative - i.e. demand to be short - in the futures market, it remained in positive territory.\n",

Since the future incorporates the cost of funding, the future \"underperforms\" the index by the cost of funding (Figure 13). Adding back the funding therefore creates a funded product that closely tracks the total return of both the underlying index as well as the related ETF (Figure 14). Benchmarks, ETFs, and Funded Futures track each other very closely with small mean-reverting deviations.\n",

       "The nature of the futures market is that the focus of liquidity is on the nearest quarterly contract (March cycle) which means that every three months, in the lead up to expiry, many market participants will look to roll their position onto the next liquid contract rather than go through expiry and cash settlement.\n",
       "\n",
       "It’s instructive to look at how the rolls have behaved historically. To do this, we look at the roll premium which we define as the cost of moving from the front (1st) to the back (2nd) contract. Since the futures’ price includes a financing cost, we need to strip this out to calculate the additional premium that an investor would need to pay to roll their contract in excess of the financing for an additional three months.\n",
       "\n",
       "Our calculation of the Roll Premium is then:\n",
       "\n",
       "$$\n",

       "\n",
       "**FairValue** = Spot + Financing\n",
       "\n",
       "Historically, we find that the roll premium has ranged from +12 to -11 cents across the various futures (Figure 17). Typically the roll cost for the European Futures (FECX and FEHY) has been positive while the roll cost for the US indices has tended to be negative, although this does vary. Here we have weighted the roll premium by the daily volume of each day in the roll period to calculate volume weighted average roll premia.\n",

       "Focusing on the rolls over the past year, we make three observations. First, the European rolls tend to trade richer with a higher cost to roll longs than the US futures. Second, the roll premium tends to decline (or trend to zero) as time passes such that closer to expiry rolls tend to be done at close to fair value costs. Finally, we note that the roll cost for Investment Grade and High Yield futures tends to be the same at the same trading venue. There does not appear to be an added cost for rolling High Yield futures. In the appendix we show the roll costs for different futures over the past few years.\n",

       "### Explanation of Credit Research Valuation Methodology, Ratings and Risk to Ratings:\n",
       "J.P. Morgan uses a bond-level rating system that incorporates valuations (relative value) and our fundamental view on the security. Our fundamental credit view of an issuer is based on the company's underlying credit trends, overall creditworthiness and our opinion on whether the issuer will be able to service its debt obligations when they become due and payable. We analyze, among other things, the company’s cash flow capacity and trends and standard credit ratios, such as gross and net leverage, interest coverage and liquidity ratios. We also analyze profitability, capitalization and asset quality, among other variables, when assessing financials. Analysts also rate the issuer, based on the rating of the benchmark or representative security. Unless we specify a different recommendation for the company’s individual securities, an issuer recommendation applies to all of the bonds at the same level of the issuer’s capital structure. We may also rate certain loans and preferred securities, as applicable. This report also sets out within the material underlying assumptions used. We use the following ratings for bonds (issues), issuers, loans, and preferred securities: Overweight (over the next three months, the recommended risk position is expected to outperform the relevant index, sector, or benchmark); Neutral (over the next three months, the recommended risk position is expected to perform in line with the relevant index, sector, or benchmark); and Underweight (over the next three months, the recommended risk position is expected to underperform the relevant index, sector, or benchmark). J.P. Morgan Emerging Markets Sovereign Research uses Marketweight, which is equivalent to Neutral. NR is Not Rated. In this case, J.P. Morgan has removed the rating for this particular security or issuer because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. NC is Not Covered. An NC designation is not a rating or a recommendation. For CDS, we use the following rating system: Long Risk (over the next three months, the credit return on the recommended position is expected to exceed relevant index, sector or benchmark); Neutral (over the next three months, the credit return on the recommended position is expected to match the relevant index, sector or benchmark); and Short Risk (over the next three months, the credit return on the recommended position is expected to underperform the relevant index, sector, or benchmark).\n",
