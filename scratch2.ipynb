       "### Abstract\n",
       "Factor models are essential tools for understanding asset returns. Statistical factor models such as principal component analysis (PCA) and autoencoders have been widely used to reduce the high-dimensional panels of returns into a lower-dimensional latent space. Although effective at retaining much of the original variance, these models often lack inherent economic interpretation and rely solely on historical data, failing to incorporate contextual features such as asset characteristics into factor construction. Consequently, ad hoc analyses are often required to assign real-world meaning to latent factors. To address these limitations, this article introduces a novel graph factor model (GFM) that integrates domain-informed sparsity, explicitly connecting factors to financially validated features to enable interpretable and robust factor extraction. Extensive experiments on modeling corporate spread returns demonstrate that the GFM captures more variance, is more robust to missing data, and provides clearer economic insights than PCA, autoencoders, and instrumented PCA. By bridging the gap between statistical performance and economic interpretability, this new framework supports tasks such as performance attribution and offers valuable insights for portfolio management.\n",

       "### Introduction\n",
       "Understanding the main drivers of asset performance is a fundamental challenge in finance. Factor models address this challenge by capturing common sources of variability among a large number of financial assets. These models decompose asset returns into a smaller set of explanatory components, called factors, each representing a distinct source of return variation. Assets respond uniquely to these factors through different weights, known as factor loadings, sensitivities, or exposures. This decomposition provides valuable insights into the systematic drivers of asset returns.\n",

       "At the core of factor models is the premise that asset returns are influenced by a set of underlying factors, which may be latent (unobservable), tied to macroeconomic variables, or derived from intrinsic characteristics. Over the years, significant effort has been devoted to identifying, constructing, and testing various factors. Early models relied on macroeconomic indicators or heuristically constructed portfolios to define factors, whereas others used observable asset fundamentals to specify factor sensitivities. These rule-based methods often fail, however, to fully capture the intricate and dynamic nature of financial datasets.  \n",
       "Statistical factor models overcome these limitations by extracting factors directly from data. Methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) have been widely used, and more recently, autoencoders—a class of machine learning algorithms designed for dimensionality reduction—have gained increasing attention (Coqueret and Guida 2023; Wang and Singh 2024). Advances in machine learning have also led to hybrid models that combine asset characteristics with statistical factor construction, offering greater flexibility and predictive power. Despite these advances, a key limitation persists: These methods lack interpretability, making it hard to derive meaningful economic insights from the extracted factors.  \n",
       "To address these gaps, we introduce a novel graph-based framework designed to explain the cross-sectional spread returns of corporate bonds. Our method bridges the gap between interpretability and performance by integrating domain knowledge into the latent structure of two core algorithms: autoencoders and matrix factorization. This knowledge, formalized as a bond-factor graph, guides the learning process to extract factors directly tied to financially relevant but unobserved features.  \n",
       "Our contribution can be summarized as follows:  \n",
       "- We propose a novel graph-based framework that integrates static bond features to enable an interpretable spread return decomposition.  \n",
       "- Our model outperforms statistical (PCA and autoencoders) and hybrid (instrumented PCA) models by capturing greater variance while demonstrating enhanced robustness to missing data.  \n",

       "The remainder of this article is organized as follows: The section “Related Work” reviews related work on factor models, highlighting the gap in interpretability for statistical factor models. The section “Methodology” details the methodology, including the design of the bond-factor graph and its integration into the autoencoder framework. The sections “Experiments” and “Results” present the experimental setup and results, demonstrating the model’s superiority in variance explanation and robustness compared to benchmark models. Finally, the sections “Discussion” and “Conclusion” discuss the implications of the findings and outline directions for future research.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Related Work\n",
       "Factor models can be broadly classified into three types: macroeconomic, fundamental, and statistical.  \n",
       "**Macroeconomic models** were the first to be studied in the literature, beginning with the seminal capital asset pricing model (CAPM) introduced by Sharpe (1964), which posits that asset returns are driven by a single factor—the market return.\n",
       "# The Journal of Financial Data Science | 3\n",
       "\n",
       "Subsequent research acknowledged the model’s limitations in fully explaining return variations and sought to extend it. For instance, the Fama–French three-factor model (Fama and French 1993) added size and value factors to capture the effects of market capitalization and book-to-market ratios alongside the market factor. Similarly, Carhart (1997) added a fourth factor, momentum, to account for the tendency of past winners to outperform past losers. More recently, the Fama and French five-factor model (Fama and French 2015) included profitability and investment factors to further enhance explanatory power.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Fundamental models** explain asset returns using firm-specific characteristics.  \n",
       "A prominent example is the BARRA model (Barra 1998), which decomposes total risk into systematic and idiosyncratic components by associating firm-level characteristics, such as industry classification, with systematic factors. The factor exposures are deterministically derived from these characteristics, whereas factor returns are estimated empirically using cross-sectional regressions of returns on exposures. Although this rule-based construction ensures interpretability, its reliance on fixed assumptions and heuristics can limit flexibility in capturing more complex relationships.  \n",
       "\n",
       "**Statistical models** extract factors directly from data using statistical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA), without necessarily tying them to observable economic variables. Although such methods maximize the fit to historical data, the resulting factors may lack economic interpretability. Recent advancements in this area include the use of machine learning techniques that automate factor construction. Autoencoders (Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams 1986), for instance, extend PCA by introducing nonlinear modeling capabilities, offering greater flexibility in uncovering complex patterns in asset returns. These methods are, however, prone to overfitting and still face challenges with interpretability.\n",
       "\n",
       "Empirical evidence suggests that fundamental and statistical models generally outperform macroeconomic ones in explanatory power (Connor 1995). Modern research has sought to bridge fundamental and statistical approaches. For instance, Kelly, Pruitt, and Su (2019) introduced instrumented principal component analysis (IPCA), a method that parametrizes factor loadings as a function of firm characteristics. This approach significantly reduces the number of parameters to estimate while showing improved capacity in explaining stock returns. Building on this idea, Gu, Kelly, and Xiu (2021) proposed a more flexible framework using autoencoders, enabling nonlinear modeling between loadings and characteristics. Finally, Kelly, Palhares, and Pruitt (2023) used a five-factor IPCA to demonstrate its suitability for modeling corporate bond returns.\n",
       "\n",
       "Our work differs from these studies in two key aspects. First, although existing hybrid approaches use time-varying factor loadings based on evolving firm characteristics, our focus is on incorporating static bond characteristics, embedded directly into the model structure through a bipartite bond-factor graph. Second, prior studies prioritize improved predictive power and factor identification with less emphasis on interpretability, as factors often remain latent and unstructured. This reduces their applicability to tasks such as performance attribution. In contrast, our approach connects unobserved bond characteristics with latent factors, enhancing the interpretability and practical utility of the decomposition.\n",

       "**Problem Formulation**  \n",
       "Let $i \\in \\{1, ..., N\\}$ denote the bond index and let $j \\in \\{1, ..., K\\}$ denote the factor index. Consider $T$ time periods $t = 1, 2, ..., T$ over which the signals are observed.\n",

       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "The goal of a factor model is to decompose the original signals into a smaller set of underlying factors such that $K \\ll N$. This article considers linear multifactor models of the form:\n",
       "\n",
       "\\[ r_{i,t} = \\sum_{j=1}^{\\kappa} \\beta_{i,j} \\cdot f_{j,t} + \\epsilon_{i,t} \\]\n",
       "\n",
       "where $r_{i,t}$ represents the signal (e.g., daily return of bond $i$ on day $t$), $f_{j,t}$ the factor realization, and $\\beta_{i,j}$ the factor loading—that is, the sensitivity of bond $i$ to factor $j$. The model residual, $\\epsilon_{i,t}$, accounts for the idiosyncratic part that cannot be explained by the factors.\n",
       "\n",
       "Factor models differ in how they define and estimate the loadings and realizations. For example, models like CAPM use macroeconomic variables as factors and estimate the loadings through time-series regression for each bond. In contrast, models like BARRA derive loadings from firm characteristics and estimate the realizations using cross-sectional regression at each time period. Statistical models, like ours, treat both loadings and realizations as unknowns, requiring estimates through statistical techniques.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Autoencoders\n",
       "\n",
       "One way to define the factors is by parameterizing them as functions of the input signals. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a widely used technique that exemplifies this approach. It is commonly used in finance to identify the principal sources of variations in financial datasets by seeking orthogonal linear projections that maximize the variance of the data in a lower-dimensional space. The identified components serve as latent factors. Although effective at reducing dimensionality, PCA is known for its lack of interpretability and inefficient use of contextual information.\n",
       "\n",
       "Autoencoders extend this idea by employing neural networks to learn compressed representations of the data. An autoencoder is composed of two main blocks: the encoder and the decoder. The encoder (Enc) maps the high-dimensional input data into a lower-dimensional representation within the latent space. The decoder (Dec) reconstructs the input from this latent representation with, hopefully, minimal distortion. This flexible framework allows autoencoders to capture more complex and potentially nonlinear relationships between signals and factors. The overall process can be summarized as:\n",
       "\n",
       "\\[ r_{t} \\xrightarrow{\\text{Enc}} f_{t} \\xrightarrow{\\text{Dec}} \\hat{r}_{t} \\]\n",
       "\n",
       "where $r_{t} = [r_{1,t}, r_{2,t}, \\ldots, r_{N,t}]^{T}$ denotes the vector of bond returns at time $t$, $f_{t} = [f_{1,t}, f_{2,t}, \\ldots, f_{N,t}]^{T}$ represents the latent factors capturing common sources of variability among the returns, and $\\hat{r}_{t}$ is the reconstructed returns vector. The notation $f_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$ indicates the latent factors capturing the common sources of variability among the returns, and $\\hat{r}_{t}$ is the reconstructed returns vector. PCA can be viewed as a special case of autoencoders, in which both the encoder and decoder are linear transformations without activation functions. Our work focuses on linear autoencoders with a single hidden layer, as illustrated in Exhibit 1, Panel A, and summarized by the following equations:\n",

       "\n",
       "Next, we build a bond-factor graph, which encodes the relationships between bonds and factors. This bipartite graph is constructed as follows: (1) Every bond and factor represent a node, resulting in two disjoint sets of nodes, $\\mathcal{U}$ and $\\mathcal{V}$, for bond and factor nodes, respectively, and (2) each bond $i \\in \\mathcal{U}$ is connected to $M$ factors based on its characteristics. We use $\\mathcal{N}(i) = \\{j \\in \\mathcal{V} : w_{j,i} \\neq 0 \\text{ and } \\beta_{j,i} \\neq 0\\}$ to denote the set of factors of bond $i$. For example, $\\mathcal{N}(i) = \\{\\text{FR, A+}\\}$ if the $i$ bond is issued from France and has an A+ rating. Similarly, $\\mathcal{N}(j)$ represents the set of bonds of the set of bonds of the $j$ factor.\n",

       "Exhibit 1. Panel B illustrates our model in contrast to a linear autoencoder. Interestingly, each part of the autoencoder in the section “Autoencoders” resembles a bond-factor graph, but with a graph that is fully connected, in which each bond is linked to all the factors. Therefore, the dense autoencoder can be seen as a special case of our model in which the features are indistinguishable: Each feature has only one value (factor) shared by all the bonds. Hence, the previous equations can be generalized to:\n",

       "where the main difference lies in the indexes over which the summation is defined. To account for the varying number of connections to each factor and to maintain an economical interpretation of factor realizations, we normalize the weights $w_{j,i}$ by the total number of bonds associated with each factor. We also explore alternative normalization techniques, namely Softmax and ReLU (Agarap 2018), so that each\n",

In the second stage, Equation 6 describes the decoding step, in which bond returns are reconstructed using the factor realizations.

       "Although our model, with $M$ features, shares the same number of parameters as a linear autoencoder, with $K = M$, it offers two distinct advantages. First, the factors are interpretable by construction, as they are directly tied to economic characteristics. Second, our method is more flexible in production environments in which the input size can vary from one time period to another. Indeed, as new bonds are issued and others mature, the dataset used for training may contain many missing values. The graph-based design handles this variation naturally by operating only on the available set of bonds.  \n",

To have as little constraint as possible on factors, we propose another variant, called credit factor model (CFM), in which the factors are defined implicitly.

A common feature of both models is that the loading matrix $B$ is designed to be sparse, embedding domain knowledge and facilitating more interpretable decomposition based on the bond-factor graph structure. Specifically, each row contains only $M$ nonzero learnable parameters, corresponding to the relevant set of factors associated with a given bond. The two models differ, however, in how $F$ is defined.  \n",

As a result, GFM resembles a symmetric autoencoder. In contrast, the credit factor model does not parametrize the realizations; instead, $F$ is considered to be latent. This approach is closer to a matrix factorization algorithm but with constrained latent structure on the loadings. Equations 8 and 9 present the objective functions of GFM and CFM, respectively. Notably, CFM has roughly half as many parameters as GFM to learn.  \n",

AE and PCA exhibit comparable performance, reaffirming their theoretical equivalence. In contrast, IPCA performs significantly worse on all metrics. We attribute the low performance of IPCA to its instrumented loading structure, which we consider ill-suited for static loadings. IPCA assumes equivalence among bonds with identical features; such bonds can, however, display differing performances over the same period. For example, two bonds sharing the same factor may show varying sensitivities to changes in that factor’s realization. Unlike IPCA, which fails to account for this asset-specific variability, our models enable similar bonds to respond differently to the same factor, enhancing their flexibility and explanatory power of the model.\n",

       "The out-of-sample results validate the ability of our models to generalize effectively to unseen data. In each fold, the models are trained on nine months of data, and the learned loadings are then applied to reconstruct daily returns in the subsequent month. The consistent outperformance of our models in the test periods proves that their strong performance is not merely a result of statistical overfitting on the training data. Two key findings emerge from these results: First, our graph-based models explain more variance and provide a better description of systematic risk in bond returns; second, they generalize more effectively to new data and exhibit stability across folds.\n",

We explored these constraints to assess their potential to enhance generalization and improve out-of-sample performance. The results indicate, however, that both models achieve the highest $R^2$ and lowest MSE with simple average normalization. Although ReLU exhibits performance closer to simple averaging, softmax consistently results in the lowest performance in out-of-sample reconstruction.

       "\n",
       "This section explores whether the models rely heavily on specific bonds to estimate their factors. Specifically, we examine model performance when some bonds unexpectedly have missing values. After training, each bond is randomly assigned to one of two groups: *masked* and *unmasked*, with a probability $p$ of being in the masked group. During inference, masked bonds are excluded from factor estimation, meaning their spreads are treated as missing (replaced with zeros) when computing the factor realizations. The estimated factors are then used to reconstruct spreads for all bonds, regardless of group assignment. Exhibit 8 illustrates how Panel $R^2$ of both groups varies with different masking probabilities.  \n",
       "*Footnote: To account for randomness, this procedure is repeated 10 times with different random seeds.*\n",
       "\n",
       "First, the performance difference between masked and unmasked bonds remains largely consistent, except for CFM under high masking probabilities ($p \\geq 0.7$). For instance, PCA shows a near-zero performance gap between the two groups. This indicates that, even if their explanatory capacity diminishes, the factors maintain a uniform explanatory power across both groups, regardless of the data used for their estimation. In other words, whether the factors are estimated using 30% or 80% of the data, they exhibit equal explanatory power across all bonds.\n",
       "\n",
       "Second, all models demonstrate resilience to a small amount of missing data, as evidenced by the close performance of unmasked bonds to the baseline (dashed black line) at low masking probabilities ($p=0.1$). As the masking probability increases ($p \\geq 0.2$), however, PCA and GFM exhibit notable declines in performance (decreasing blue curves), whereas CFM remains more stable (flat blue curve). This difference arises from the models’ factor estimation approaches: CFM dynamically finds factors that minimize the reconstruction error on the available data, whereas PCA and GFM rely on a more rigid approach using pre-learned encoder weights, leading to sharper declines in performance.\n",
       "\n",
       "Finally, the performance of the masked (red) group provides insights into whether the estimated factors overfit the available data or generalize well by explaining bonds that were not used in their estimation. Notably, CFM factors preserve high explanatory power and maintain a clear advantage over other models, even under high masking probabilities. For instance, at $p=0.5$, the panel $R^2$ of the masked group across the three folds is 65%, 46%, and 41% for CFM, 51%, 38%, and 37% for PCA, and 50%, 35%, and 36% for GFM (i.e., when using only half of the bonds to estimate the factors, CFM explains approximately up to 30% more variance in the remaining bonds compared with PCA or GFM). These findings highlight the potential of CFM to handle incomplete datasets in real-world scenarios, in which missing data is common, making it a more reliable tool for robust factor analysis.\n",

       "# DISCUSSION\n",
       "This article introduces two dimensionality reduction algorithms that integrate domain knowledge through a graph-based approach. We posit that bond spreads are influenced by certain key factors, which are unobserved and derived from static features such as credit rating and sector. Our methods construct a bond-factor graph that captures the relationships between bonds and their associated features. The sparse connectivity of this graph informs the structure of our models: In GFM, the connections of a linear autoencoder are configured to align with the graph structure, enforcing an interpretable mapping between the input space (bonds) and the latent space (factors), and vice versa; in CFM, the loading matrix of a linear factor model adopts the same sparse structure as the graph’s adjacency matrix.\n",

       "\n",
       "Our results show that integrating this knowledge not only improves explanatory power but also enhances the interpretability and robustness of the models. The practical value of our approach lies in its interpretable decomposition, which, unlike other statistical and hybrid approaches, enables the models to uncover relevant factors with clear financial interpretations. This makes the model particularly useful for applications such as risk management, in which understanding factor contributions is essential. For instance, the learned decomposition could facilitate performance attribution by breaking down portfolio returns (or risks) into contributions from distinct economic factors. In future work, we aim to explore this application in greater depth, along with others, such as covariance estimation and portfolio construction.\n",
       "\n",
       "Despite their strengths, our methods have a notable limitation: Unlike PCA, the learned factors are not necessarily uncorrelated. Exhibits A2, A3, and A4 illustrate the correlation matrix of the learned factors across various models. Although PCA (Exhibit A2) ensures orthogonality, the factors in both GFM (Exhibit A3) and CFM (Exhibit A4) reveal a higher degree of correlation, particularly among factors within the same category (e.g., sector), as highlighted by the block structure. Notably, CFM displays lower correlations compared to GFM. It is worth noting that having orthogonal factors is not necessarily desirable: PCA often fails to uncover useful factors beyond the first few components, limiting its ability to capture diverse sources of variations. Conversely, very high correlations between factors can render a model ineffective, as they may collapse into just a few dominant ones. Investigating the trade-off between interpretability and factor independence remains an open question and is a topic for future exploration.\n",
       "\n",
       "## CONCLUSION\n",
       "\n",
       "We present a novel multifactor framework that retrofits two prominent models—a linear autoencoder and matrix factorization—with domain-informed sparsity to improve interpretability. By leveraging a bipartite bond-factor graph to inform the model architectures, the framework integrates bond features into the factor specification, enabling the latent space to capture both statistical variance and domain-specific knowledge. This design makes the framework particularly well-suited for applications such as performance attribution and risk decomposition.\n",
       "\n",
       "Experimental results on modeling the spread returns of corporate bonds demonstrate that these models surpass PCA, traditional autoencoders, and IPCA in explaining greater variance. Additionally, the CFM variant exhibits improved robustness to missing data, making it a reliable solution for scenarios with data inconsistency. Future work will focus on extending the framework to incorporate dynamic factors, such as time to maturity, and other observable factors, such as interest rates. We also aim to explore the broader applications, including profit-and-loss attribution, risk management, and portfolio construction, to further assess the model’s practical utility.\n",
