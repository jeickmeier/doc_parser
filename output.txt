Credit Index Futures are a recent addition to the suite of macro credit products. 
•
These instruments offer an avenue for efficient, unfunded access to credit 
markets.
•
We detail the current offering, how the futures work and the opportunities they 
offer.
As credit markets have matured and become electronified, macro credit products 
- instruments that give broad exposure to the market - have become an increasingly 
used and liquid part of the investor toolbox.  One of the more recent additions to the 
suite of available products are credit futures offered by Eurex, CBOE and CME. 
These products allow investors to gain broad access to investment grade and high 
yield USD, EUR or GBP corporate credit bond markets.
As futures, the instruments are exchange traded and allow unfunded exposure to 
the underlying market. The underlying instrument in the futures are bond indices 
offered by either S&P or Bloomberg. These indices are total return indices, which 
means that investors have exposure to the yield return of the bonds in the indices.
Credit index futures volumes have grown rapidly over the past few years. with 
outstanding Open Interest now at 4.5bn and average daily volumes of close to $1bn 
in 2025. While these volumes are small in comparison to some of the other macro 
credit products (CDS indices traded $150bn/day in 2025, see CD Player, 18 June), 
they have now overtaken Total Return Swap volumes, increasing three times vs 
2024.

Introducing Credit Index Futures
Uses
The case for credit futures is that they provide flexible and scalable instruments for 
managing corporate bond exposures. The standardised nature of the instrument, along 
with it being exchange traded and centrally cleared, means that it has appeal to a broad 
array of market participants and can provide cost-effective access to corporate bond 
benchmarks. Typical use cases are:
•
Liquidity and cash management. When large fund inflows occur, it can be 
efficient to take exposure to the benchmark index returns via futures which are 
unfunded while maintaining cash and searching for the right bonds to buy.
•
Hedging purposes. For a fund pursuing an active bond selection aimed at 
outperforming the market, futures can be used to temporarily reduce portfolio 
market exposure.
•
Portfolio overlay and beta adjustment. Futures can be used to increase or reduce 
market exposure in a portfolio.
•
Tactical and relative value trades. Credit Index Futures typically reference the 
same or similar markets to ETFs, TRS and CDS indices. As such, investors can 
trade relative value between these instruments to take advantage of pricing 
discrepancies. The underlying benchmark indices for different products can be found 
in the appendix.
Exchange Offerings
Credit Index futures are currently offered by three exchanges - Eurex, Cboe and CME. 
All three have futures referencing USD Investment Grade and High Yield indices. In 
addition, Eurex offers futures on Euro and Sterling Investment Grade and Euro High 
Yield indices. CME has also launched a duration-hedged USD Investment Grade and 
High Yield products, which give investors exposure to the credit spread component of 
the total return while hedging the rates component.
Volumes and Open Interest
Volumes and open interest in credit futures have continued to grow in 2025 with open 
interest recently passing $4.5bn and average daily volumes of close to $1bn over the 
past few months (Figure 1Open interest acros Credit futures and Figure 2Traded volumes). While this is somewhat skewed by the roll 
periods, June 2025 saw $1bn of average daily activity compared to $600m of daily 
activity in June 2024.

By open interest, Eurex and Cboe are the largest futures with EUR IG futures offered by 
EUREX currently close to $2bn in outstanding notional (Table 2Credit Futures Volume and Open Interest by Ticker). From a daily traded 
volume perspective, however, most products exhibit similar liquidity, trading around 
$50-100bn on a daily basis in 2025. As highlighted above, volumes have picked up 
sharply in 2025, more than doubling for most products.

Contract mechanics
Credit futures are cash-settled products traded on an underlying total return corporate 
bond index. The cash-settled nature of the product means that at expiry, the investor will 
pay (or receive) the difference between the initial entry price and the final price on 
settlement, determined by the exchange. Typically, however, market participants will 
either roll or unwind their position prior to the futures expiry such that few futures are 
likely to settle at the final price. Daily margining of the product means that there is 
unlikely to be a large payment on exit as the total return over the period includes the 
daily mark-to-market valuation.

J P M O R G A N
Unlike bond futures, which settle on a cash price of the bond (with a factor adjustment), 
credit index futures settle on a total return index. The daily return of the underlying 
index is the aggregate price return of all the underlying bonds in the index, plus the 
daily accrued from each bond. It is, in essence, a dirty price index that includes any 
coupons paid by the underlying bonds. Over time, the index accrues positively, 
reflecting the total return of the bonds in the index. 
For example, the Euro Investment Grade future offered by Eurex, FECX (Bloomberg 
Ticker: LXY), references the Bloomberg MSCI Euro Corporate Bond Socially 
Responsible Index (RECMTREU). This underlying index includes all euro-denominated 
corporate bonds that meet the inclusion criteria set by Bloomberg and MSCI. The future 
price reflects the level of the index plus funding to the term of the future, as we discuss 
later. The upward trend in the index differs from the price of a comparable ETF as 
coupons/dividends are not paid out of the index but rather accumulated (Figure 3Euro IG Future Contract and Benchmark). 
Expiry
The three exchanges offer quarterly expiries - March, June, September and December - 
with most liquidity focused on the front contract. This means that in July, the September 
contract would be the most liquid across the available options. As expiry approaches, 
investors will typically roll onto the next available contract (Figure 4FECX Open Interest) in the two weeks 
prior to expiry. The roll expiry date does differ between the exchanges with Eurex 
settling on the third Friday of the expiry month, Cboe settling on the first business day 
of the expiry month and CME settling on the third Wednesday of the expiry month. In 
the appendix we detail the historical performance and cost of the quarterly rolls. 
Trading Hours
One of the attractions of futures is that they provide almost round-the-clock trading, 
thereby extending the hours at which market participants can adjust their exposure to the 
underlying market. Eurex hours are 7.50am to 10.00pm CET, Cboe and CME hours are 
5.00pm the previous day to 4.00pm Chicago time.

Contract Sizing and Multipliers
Contracts trade with a contract multiplier that gives the investor a notional exposure to 
the underlying index. For example, the USD IG future traded on Cboe (IBIG) has a 
contract multiplier of 1,000. Suppose the traded future has a price of 137.86; this means 
that one contract will have market exposure of $137,860. This is a market value

exposure rather than notional so is equivalent to Bond Price * Notional for a single 
bond. An investor who wants to have $100m of market exposure would therefore buy 
725 contracts (= $100m / (137.86 * 1,000)).
Sizing and PnL Example
A credit PM gets an inflow of $50mm in early January and is looking for a quick and 
efficient way to gain all-in yield (spread and interest rate) exposure to the broad USD IG 
market. The PM can do so by purchasing CME QIB futures while awaiting new 
issuance / supporting secondary conditions to invest cash. The PnL of the trade will 
track the total return performance of the USD IG benchmark (in this case as represented 
by the LUACTRUU Index) less financing costs, which could be offset by putting the 
cash into a money market account.
Let’s assume the inflow arrives on 8 January 2025; the liquid / nearest future contract is 
the March Expiry (QIBH25). Assume Bid/Offer is 3290.00 / 3293.00. For reference, the 
previous EOD close of the NAV for LUACTRUU index was 3269.31.
The contract multiplier is 30 so a single contract exposure / value is $98,790 (=3293 x 
30). To get $50mm exposure (off the offer side, but can also use mid or bid), the PM 
would look to purchase 506 contacts (=$50mm/$98,790). The trade exposure is 
$49,987,740, but only Initial Margin changes hands initially. Given the initial margin is 
1.3%, the PM posts $649,841 at trade initiation. Margins will often be lower than this as 
exchanges will often give offsets for offsetting trades, e.g. on a rates CME-cleared 
product, the PM could get up to 75% offset. There are additional fees paid to the 
exchange, but these are typically small.
As the market moves, the Variation Margin will be paid/received and calculated as 
(Daily Settlement Price – Entry Price) x # of contracts. As the contract approaches 
expiry, the futures price will converge to the underlying index level (aka spot). If the PM 
holds the futures to the settlement on Wednesday, 19 March (last trading date would be 
Tuesday 18 March), the cash settlement will be based on the NAV index fixing, for that 
day at 4pm ET. For example, LUACTRUU Index NAV on 19 March was 3355.86, so 
the total P&L would be $954,215 (=(3355.86 - 3293) x 506 x 30) or 1.91% appreciation 
from Trade Date on the exposure of $50mm. 
Note that the benchmark return for LUACTRUU over this period was 2.65%, with the 
difference due to the transaction cost and financing cost component (which is embedded 
in the futures price – see more discussion later), which deducts from the PnL long in 
case of long risk / buy futures position. The difference of 0.74% is roughly equal to 
financing the trade at SOFR (4.25%) for 70 days.
If the PM were to unwind the position prior to expiry, the PnL will be calculated in a 
similar fashion, but using exit price / bid quote of the contract. Alternatively, the PM 
may choose to keep the exposure and roll the position (by selling the “expiring” near-
month futures and purchase far-month futures), typically several days prior to the 
contract’s last trading day to avoid PIN risk of the underlying index and ensure certainty 
of the trading levels, roll and financing costs.
The following tables summarise the available contracts for the Investment Grade and 
High Yield markets.

Future Financing - Implied Funding Spreads for Credit Futures
In this section, we take a look at the funding level priced into the futures and how we 
can use this to imply demand/supply and relative value opportunities.
Future Fair Value
The pricing of the future is based on the cost of financing a replicating basket for the 
underlying index from trade date to expiry. A future with three months to expiry will 
therefore be priced based on the cost of borrowing money to finance the underlying 
portfolio for three months. The fair value for the future is shown in Figure 5Future Fair Value. The 
pricing dynamic of the future and index can be seen in Figure 6Future versus Spot, where we plot the next 
future contract relative to the underlying index spot level. The two time-series are 
correlated, but the future pulls to spot as time passes such that on expiry day, the future 
and spot are the same level. In Figure 7Premium of the Future 1st and 2nd Contract we plot the 1st and 2nd Future contract relative to 
the spot. The 2nd contract starts with a greater premium to the spot due to the longer time 
to expiry. This pulls lower until the 2nd contract becomes the 1st contract and eventually 
expires at the spot.

Future Premium or Basis
As discussed, there is a fair value or theoretical level of the future, however since the 
future trades in the market, it frequently trades away from fair value. This allows us to 
back out the implied funding rate from the traded level of the future, as shown in Figure 
8Implied Future Funding from Future Price, which we can compare to the market funding rate (SOFR/ESTR) as shown in Figure 
9Implied Funding from 1st and 2nd Contract relative to the market financing (ESTR). Alternatively, we can look at the difference between the traded Future and fair value 
of the Future to back out the net Premium or Basis of the Future (Figure 10Implied Premium of Future versus Fair Value).

This Premium/Basis is the cost of being long or short the future in excess of the funding 
cost - on an annualised basis, it can be thought of as the implied funding spread. For a 
cash asset, this is the financing or borrow cost of the asset. If the Premium is positive, it 
means that there is demand to be long the asset and a positive associated financing cost. 
Similarly, if the Premium is negative, there is demand to be short the asset and therefore 
a financing or borrow cost embedded in the future’s price.
Adjusted Future Basis
The nature of credit index futures, specifically the fact that it is a theoretical portfolio of 
bonds meeting the inclusion criteria, means that there is there is some latency in 
updating the level of the bonds in the underlying index. The premium also captures this 
latency as a premium or discount reflecting the true price of the bond portfolio. An 
analogy is the premium-to-NAV on an ETF where the ETF updates more frequently than 
the underlying bonds and therefore trades at a premium or discount to reflect this. The 
ETF additionally captures a bid/ask spread since the ETF NAV is marked at the bid, 
while transactions tend to happen at the offer.
It is not clear to us whether this second market quantity should be captured by the 
future’s premium since the future does expire at NAV — in theory, an investor could 
buy or sell the future and capture this premium on a quarterly basis as the future expires 
and rolls to NAV. However, since most transactions are rolled, or closed prior to expiry, 
the premium is not available in practice. In practice, one would typically hedge with the 
ETF rather than a portfolio of bonds and as such the index latency would typically 
disappear from the trade.
Adjusting the spot index by the ETF Premium-to-NAV (in excess of typical B/O) 
therefore allows us to back out the clean funding spread of the future. In Figure 11Future and TRS Funding Spread we 
show the funding spread implied by the future compared to the funding spread implied 
from the TRS market over the last three years (CD Player, 2 Sep 2016, for more on TRS 
and ETFs). The two are correlated, but opportunities often exist where one may offer a 
better trade in one direction or the other. Figure 12Future and TRS Funding Spread shows some recent history, where we 
can see that while the funding spread in EUR IG TRS is very negative - i.e. demand to 
be short - in the futures market, it remained in positive territory.

Funded and Unfunded Returns
One can view the future as an unfunded index position — i.e. being long the future is 
the same as being long the underlying and funding the position. Since the future 
incorporates the cost of funding, the future “underperforms” the index by the cost of 
funding (Figure 13Future versus Underlying Index). Adding back the funding therefore creates a funded product that 
closely tracks the total return of both the underlying index as well as the related ETF 
(Figure 14Funded Future versus Underlying Index / ETF). Benchmarks, ETFs and Funded Futures track each other very closely with 
small mean-reverting deviations.

These deviations are driven by the funding spread, which tends to be mean reverting. In 
Figure 15Relative Performance and Premium - Index we show the funding spread versus the relative performance of the Future 
versus Index, while in Figure 16Relative Performance and Premium - ETF we show the funding spread, adjusted for the ETF 
Premium-to-NAV, versus the relative performance of the Future versus ETF. This 
suggests that trading the Future versus the ETF can be a profitable trade as the investor 
is able to monetise the funding spread of the Future. It also offers a measure of relative 
value for investors looking to be long via the ETF, TRS or Future.

Future Roll Season
The nature of the futures market is that the focus of liquidity is on the nearest quarterly 
contract (March cycle) which means that every three months, in the lead up to expiry, 
many market participants will look to roll their position onto the next liquid contract 
rather than go through expiry and cash settlement. 
It’s instructive to look at how the rolls have behaved historically. To do this, we look at 
the roll premium which we define as the cost of moving from the front (1st) to the back 
(2nd) contract. Since the futures’ price includes a financing cost, we need to strip this 
out to calculate the additional premium that an investor would need to pay to roll their 
contract in excess of the financing for an additional three months. 
Our calculation of the Roll Premium is then:
where:
Historically, we find that the roll premium has ranged from +12 to -11 cents across the 
various futures (Figure 17W
eighted Average Rol Premium by Future). Typically the roll cost for the European Futures (FECX and 
FEHY) has been positive while the roll cost for the US indices has tended to be 
negative, although this does vary. Here we have weighted the roll premium by the daily 
volume of each day in the roll period to calculate volume weighted average roll premia.

Focusing on the rolls over the past year, we make three observations. First, the European 
rolls tend to trade richer with a higher cost to roll longs than the US futures. Second, the 
roll premium tends to decline (or trend to zero) as time passes such that closer to expiry 
rolls tend to be done at close to fair value costs. Finally, we note that the roll cost for 
Investment Grade and High Yield futures tends to be the same at the same trading 
venue. There does not appear to be an added cost for rolling High Yield futures. In the 
appendix we show the roll costs for different futures over the past few years.

Credit Futures Data in DataQuery
To facilitate transparency in this corner of the market, we have added a rich historical 
dataset for Credit futures, which is accessible via DataQuery. The first step to access the 
data is to navigate DataQuery’s option menu selecting Asset Class→ F&O → Futures. 
Once in this directory, selecting Credit on both “Tickers” and “Attributes” panels will 
display both the available credit futures and the relevant attributes for each futures 
ticker. Figure 18Credit Futures menu on DataQuery shows how to navigate to the dataset on the DataQuery menu.
Figure 18: Credit Futures menu on DataQuery
Numbers indicate the menu navigation steps.
Source: J.P. Morgan, DataQuery.
At present we have data for eleven corporate credit futures available for trading across 
the Eurex, Cboe and CME exchanges covering both investment grade and high yield 
credit bond indices.  Some of these futures have been trading for some time now (e.g. 
IBIG, which launched in 2018) while others have launched only recently (e.g. DHY 
which launched March 2025). 
For each ticker, under the “Contracts” menu, it is possible to access information not 
only of the nearest-to-expiration contract (“FRONT”), but also of contracts with later 
expiry dates that have already started trading (up to “BACK20”). For each Credit future, 
the following attributes can be accessed:
•
Open/Close – Credit future daily price at the open/close. 
•
High/Low – Highest and lowest traded intra-day price of the Credit future.
•
Open Interest – Indicates the total number of outstanding contracts of a Credit 
future with a specified maturity that have not yet been closed or settled.
•
Open Interest (aggregate) – Total number of outstanding contracts of a particular 
Credit future across all currently trading maturities. This is usually equal to the open 
interest of the front contract or the open interest sum of the front + back contracts, 
with back contract trading becoming more important closer to the front contract 
expiry.
•
Volume –Total daily traded number of contracts of a Credit future.
•
Volume (aggregate) – Total traded number of contracts of a Credit future across all 
currently trading maturities (usually equal to the volume of the front contract or the 
sum between front + back contract when the front contract is nearing expiry).
•
Contract Month (rolling only) – The specified Credit futures contract year and

month of expiry in the format “yyyymm”.
•
Future’s last trade date – Last trade date in the format “yyyymmdd”.
•
Ticker – Ticker for a specific Credit future contract, usually a concatenation of the 
futures ticker, last two digits of the expiry year and expiry month code.
•
Contract Size – Contract multiplier defining how much (measured in EUR, USD or 
GBP) each Credit futures contract changes for an increase in value of 1 tick.
•
Fair Value – Calculated as the underlying index spot price + financing. Financing is 
estimated using ESTR or SOFR rates depending on the contract and the number of 
remaining days until the last trading date. Specifically, Fair Value is calculated as 
IndexSpot * (1+Rates)^(DaysToLastTrade/360).
•
Net Basis – Calculated as the funding spread between fair value and the future close 
price (ClosePrice/FairValue – 1) in basis points.
This menu also allows the estimation of returns from holding (and rolling) futures 
contracts. Specifically, we have included:
•
Excess Return – Daily returns of the Credit future measured in percent changes of 
closing prices. By default, when calculating these returns across a time period where 
rolling is necessary, it is assumed that this roll happens on the last trading day of the 
front contract. 
•
Excess Return Index – Excess return time series of the Credit future across the 
specified time frame. These are based on the cumulative changes in excess returns. 
This series is generated dynamically and depends not only on the start and end dates 
specified but also on the calendar settings used. For a correct estimation of these 
returns, the Calendar setting “All Weekdays” should be used to make sure all 
relevant days are taken into account. 
Other than these fields, it is also possible to access time series data for the calendar or 
business days remaining on a specific contract to the last trade or to delivery by 
selecting these fields on the Attributes menu. Given that these are cash settled products, 
the concept of first and last delivery is not directly applicable (i.e. there is only one 
delivery date).
To facilitate rolling of futures contracts, we have included the ability to roll either at the 
futures expiry (e.g. ROLLING FRONT IBHY), on a particular day of the month (e.g. 
ROLLING FRONT IBHY 5) or a given number of days prior to the future expiry (e.g. 
ROLLING FRONT IBHY LAG 10).
One of the advantages of having this data on DataQuery is the ability to now compare 
the returns from Credit futures with those of different credit asset classes and uncover 
potential trading insights using nothing but DataQuery’s user interface on J.P. Morgan 
Markets. For instance, we might want to compare the total returns of selling CDS 
protection on CDX.HY versus buying and rolling IBHY futures as depicted in Figure 19CDX.HY (orange) vs IBHY (blue) Futures returns in 
DataQuery. You can copy and paste the following expressions to DataQuery in order to replicate 
the figure:
•
MUL(1+RETURN(ROLLING FRONT IBHY )/100)*100Futures 
•
DB(CDS,TRAC-X,NAHY100UNF05ONRUN,JPM_RETURN)

On the other hand, we might want to compare where Credit futures’ premium levels 
stand compared to other derivative instruments, in a similar way to what we have done 
in our previous future Financing theme (CD Player, March 26). More specifically, we 
may wish to compare the financing spread or net basis of our IBHY future to the 
financing spread of a TRS that allows exposure to the same underlying. Similar to our 
return analysis, this can also now be done in DataQuery (Figure 20Funding Spread for IBHY Credit Futures (orange) vs iBox USD HY TRS (purple)). To get these 
results, copy and paste the following expressions to your DQ expression menu:
•
ROLLING FRONT IBHY 10 
•
($1/FAIRVALUE($1) -1)*10000
•
(DB(CDS,TRAC-X,EUROPEIBXTRS_USDHY_0M,JPM_LEVEL_MID)/
DB(IBXTRS,EUROPEIBXTRS_USDHY,TRI)-1)*10000
And select expressions 2 and 3 for highlight in the Chart menu.

Explanation of Credit Research Valuation Methodology, Ratings and Risk to Ratings:
 J.P. Morgan uses a bond-level rating system that incorporates valuations (relative value) and our fundamental view on the security. Our 
fundamental credit view of an issuer is based on the company's underlying credit trends, overall creditworthiness and our opinion on whether the 
issuer will be able to service its debt obligations when they become due and payable. We analyze, among other things, the company's cash flow 
capacity and trends and standard credit ratios, such as gross and net leverage, interest coverage and liquidity ratios. We also analyze profitability, 
capitalization and asset quality, among other variables, when assessing financials. Analysts also rate the issuer, based on the rating of the 
benchmark or representative security. Unless we specify a different recommendation for the company’s individual securities, an issuer 
recommendation applies to all of the bonds at the same level of the issuer’s capital structure. We may also rate certain loans and preferred 
securities, as applicable. This report also sets out within it the material underlying assumptions used. We use the following ratings for bonds 
(issues), issuers, loans, and preferred securities: Overweight (over the next three months, the recommended risk position is expected to 
outperform the relevant index, sector, or benchmark); Neutral (over the next three months, the recommended risk position is expected to perform 
in line with the relevant index, sector, or benchmark); and Underweight (over the next three months, the recommended risk position is expected 
to underperform the relevant index, sector, or benchmark). J.P. Morgan Emerging Markets Sovereign Research uses Marketweight, which is 
equivalent to Neutral. NR is Not Rated. In this case, J.P. Morgan has removed the rating for this particular security or issuer because of either a 
lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating no longer should be relied upon. An NR 
designation is not a recommendation or a rating. NC is Not Covered. An NC designation is not a rating or a recommendation. For CDS, we use 
the following rating system: Long Risk (over the next three months, the credit return on the recommended position is expected to exceed the 
relevant index, sector or benchmark); Neutral (over the next three months, the credit return on the recommended position is expected to match 
the relevant index, sector or benchmark); and Short Risk (over the next three months, the credit return on the recommended position is expected 
to underperform the relevant index, sector or benchmark).
